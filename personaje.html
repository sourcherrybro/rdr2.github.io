        <td style="text-align:left;">Arthur Morgan is the main protagonist of Red Dead Redemption 2. As a senior member and lead enforcer of the Van der Linde gang, the outlaw life is all he’s ever known. Dutch took Arthur in at the age of 14—a troubled, angry boy who had been living on the streets after losing his parents. Under Dutch’s guidance, Arthur became his first true protégé, turning from a lost cause into the gang’s most loyal and capable enforcer.

Arthur is intelligent, calm under pressure, and a ruthless killer when needed, but he lives by his own code of honor. He takes pride in his ability to get the job done.</td>

By 1899, John is married to Abigail Roberts and is the father of their son, Jack.</td>

He doesn’t view himself as a criminal, but as a revolutionary fighting against a corrupt and oppressive system. In his early years, Dutch dreamed of creating a free and wild utopia in the West—believing that with enough struggle and sacrifice, he could change the world.

He took in orphans and lost souls like Arthur Morgan and John Marston, teaching them to read and encouraging self-worth and independence. Dutch is idealistic, anarchic, and deeply charismatic, but as the modern world closes in, the cracks in his vision—and his sanity—begin to show.</td>

A master con artist, gentleman, and seasoned thief, Hosea has been at Dutch’s side for over twenty years. The two first met while trying to rob each other on the road to Chicago and quickly bonded over their shared ideals, becoming close partners in crime.

Smart and quick-witted, Hosea has a talent for talking his way into—and out of—almost any situation. Though still sharp, he's beginning to feel the weight of age catching up with him.</td>

After witnessing her husband Jake’s murder during a raid on their home, Sadie is consumed by a desire for revenge. Raised on rugged mountain land, she’s tough, self-reliant, and skilled in riding, hunting, and shooting.

She and Jake shared all the work on their farm until tragedy turned her world upside down. Fearless, relentless, and fiercely independent, Sadie is not someone to be crossed—but she’s deeply loyal to those she cares about.</tr>

Quiet and reserved, Charles is highly skilled in everything he does. Born to a Native American mother and African American father, he’s spent his life on the move, never truly feeling like he belongs anywhere.

He joined Dutch’s gang because he connected with their sense of loyalty and found a place where he could finally fit in. A master tracker and hunter, Charles is a principled, honest man—calm and compassionate, yet deadly when necessary. He struggles to hold onto his values in a world that often rejects them.</td>

Coming from a long line of notorious criminals—his father and grandfather both named Micah Bell, with his father wanted for murder in five counties—Micah is wild, unpredictable, and nihilistic. He thrives on chaos and is deadly skilled in gunfights.

After being dishonorably discharged from the U.S. Army in his early twenties for attempted murder and misconduct, Bill descended into a violent life of drinking, intimidation, and crime.

Dutch found him around 1893, took him under his wing, and helped steer him away from self-destruction. Hot-headed and quick to anger, Bill is often the butt of jokes within the gang. He acts impulsively but is fiercely loyal, tough, and always ready for a fight. </td>

A notorious bounty hunter and Mexican revolutionary from Nuevo Paraíso, Javier was forced to flee his homeland after killing a high-ranking army officer over a woman, unable to return until the political situation changes.

He joined the gang around 1895 and quickly connected with Dutch’s ideals. Passionate and deeply loyal—sometimes to a fault—Javier is one of Dutch’s most reliable members. He also takes great pride in his appearance and is always impeccably dressed.</td>

Strong-willed, straightforward, and resilient, Abigail knows what it takes to survive against all odds.

Introduced to Dutch’s gang by Uncle in 1894, she soon became pregnant. Her son Jack is her greatest pride and motivation, and she’s determined to give him a better, more loving childhood—no matter what.</td>

Born and raised within the gang, Jack has been protected from its darker side as much as possible. He feels fortunate to have a loving mother and many aunts and uncles to care for him, though he wishes he could spend more time with his father and have other children to play with.

At just fifteen, Lenny went on the run for murder after defending himself when some drunks attacked and killed his father. Raised by well-educated family members, he received a good education and grew up smart, capable, and ambitious.

Lenny is eager to contribute and appreciates being part of a community where he’s valued for his skills rather than judged by his appearance.</td>

He manages the gang’s finances and runs their money-lending operations. Serious, somewhat secretive, and unemotional, Strauss has all the qualities of a skilled loan shark.

Born into poverty in Vienna within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, he faced serious health issues as a child. At 17, he was sent to the New World, where years of scamming led him to join Dutch’s gang for protection. He has remained loyal to Dutch ever since.</tr>

Known as a hanger-on and a good-time guy, Uncle is always nearby when there’s whiskey flowing but mysteriously absent when work needs doing. No one is sure how old he is or if he’s really anyone’s uncle.

He’s lived a colorful life, full of wild stories about many wives and travels around the world. He also claims to suffer from terminal lumbago. If he weren’t so entertaining, Dutch would have kicked him out long ago.

A cocky young Irish thief and stick-up man, Sean comes from a long line of criminals and political rebels. His father, a wanted man, fled with him to America but was later killed by British pursuers.

Sean first crossed paths with Dutch and Hosea in North Elizabeth when he unsuccessfully tried to steal Dutch’s pocket watch. Bold and brash, Sean loves to stir things up and always wants a share of the action, sometimes believing in himself a bit too much.

Pearson spent some time at sea, a period he enjoys talking about at length. Coming from a family of sperm whale hunters, he planned to follow their path, but by the time he finished school, whale oil had lost its value.

Heading west, he got into trouble with some men shaking him down for money. Dutch found him at his lowest and took him under his wing. Loud and jovial, Pearson often hides his struggles behind a cheerful facade, somewhat in denial about how his life has changed.

Having been with the gang almost as long as Arthur, Susan once had a relationship with Dutch. Even after it ended, they remain close partners in crime. Years on the outlaw trail have made her a bit jaded, but she embraces it. Tenacious and strong-willed, Susan tolerates no nonsense.

She claims to come from a well-off Irish family who moved to America seeking adventure and excitement. While she found excitement with Dutch, she wants more than he can or is willing to give. Seeing herself as above the other gang members hasn’t made her very popular in camp.

Orphaned at a young age after her mother died of typhoid, Mary-Beth ran away from the orphanage to survive on her own and quickly gained a reputation as an expert pickpocket. Smarter and more insightful than she appears, she loves reading and writing, dreaming of becoming a novelist one day.

An outlaw for nearly as long as she can remember, Tilly was kidnapped from her mother by another gang when she was just 12. After enduring years of abuse, she killed one of the gang members and escaped.

Heading down a dangerous path, she was found by Dutch, who took her in, protected her, and taught her to read. Savvy, resilient, and responsible, Tilly is capable of handling herself and isn’t afraid to speak her mind.

He began using morphine to ease pain a few years ago, but it quickly became a destructive addiction. A broken man who has lost his self-esteem, purpose, and much of his faith, Swanson is painfully aware of his failures. If he hadn’t saved Dutch’s life in the past, the gang likely wouldn’t have kept him around this long.

He often appears out of nowhere with valuable leads, then vanishes like a magic trick. Hard to pin down and not always trustworthy, he nonetheless brings useful information and some much-needed entertainment to the gang. A cockroach in fancy britches, Trelawny can slip into places others cannot.

Their differing views on how to confront the military create tension between them.</td>
