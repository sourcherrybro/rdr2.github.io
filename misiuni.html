    <blockquote>
        After a botched robbery, the gang flees from Blackwater into the Grizzly Mountains, only to be caught in a brutal late spring storm. Struggling with hunger and near-freezing conditions, they seek refuge in an abandoned mining town, hoping for the storm to pass and a chance to regroup.

    <section class="main-content">
        
    <blockquote>
After the weather clears, the gang descends from the mountains and takes refuge at Horseshoe Overlook, located near Valentine, a muddy livestock town. As they recover their strength, they begin planning their next moves. Dutch is working on a new strategy for the gang, Hosea is scouting potential places to rob, while Karen and the other women grow restless after their time in the mountains. Meanwhile, some old friends make a reappearance.    </blockquote>

    <section class="main-content">
        <blockquote>
            After a confrontation with railway magnate Leviticus Cornwall, who’s fed up with having his trains robbed, the gang is forced to leave Valentine. Worried that Pinkerton agents are watching the western routes, they move south and east, eventually taking refuge at Clemens Cove, near the town of Rhodes.

Rhodes is a decaying town that’s lost much of its former charm, now caught in a bitter feud between two prominent local families—the Grays and the Braithwaites. Dutch and Hosea plan to exploit this conflict for their own gain.

        <blockquote>
            Things went south in Rhodes when the Pinkertons reappeared, and young Jack Marston was kidnapped.

The gang tracks Jack to Saint Denis, but they’re now hiding in the swamps outside the city at a decrepit manor called Shady Belle. Dutch is urgently trying to come up with an escape plan for everyone, while Hosea is on the hunt for a big score to secure their future.

    <section class="main-content">
        <blockquote>
            The Saint Denis bank robbery was a disaster, leaving the gang nearly destroyed, with many killed or captured. Dutch, Micah, Javier, Bill, and Arthur managed to escape on a boat, but it sank in the Caribbean, washing them ashore on Guarma, an island off Cuba. Ruled by the tyrant Colonel Fussar and dominated by sugar companies, the gang is pressured by a Haitian smuggler, Hercule, to help him in exchange for a way back to America.

            What’s left of the gang reunited at Lakay, but their time there was short-lived as they were quickly attacked by a Pinkerton squad.

Fleeing north into dangerous territory, they’re now hiding in Beaver Hollow, uncertain of their fate and torn apart by internal conflicts and anxieties. Arthur, feeling unwell and uncertain about what to do next, struggles with his own thoughts as the gang waits in limbo.
